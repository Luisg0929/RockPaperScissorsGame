# RockPaperScissorsGame
A program that I can use different programming languages for a rock ,paper, scissors game

My goals for this program is to implement a fun rock paper scissors game, first in the console

Then implement UI and other visually appealing things

Things Ive learned while doing this project:

Ive learned that it is not easy to manipulate the DOM, working with event listeners and other DOM 
manipulation techniques can be hard and confusing. 

Ive also could of used lots of OOP principles by making lots of functions that I could of re-used in my program
although I mainly was focusing on code fucntionality rather than code readability for this project.
